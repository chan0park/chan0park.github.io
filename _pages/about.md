Iâ€™m a second year PhD student advised by [Yulia Tsvetkov](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ytsvetko/) at [Language Technologies Institute](https://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu). My research interests are in the area of natural language processing and artificial intelligence. More specifically, I'm interested in a broad range of natural language generation problems such as data-to-text and machine translation, and bias in the text. I am a recipient of [KFAS Fellowship](http://kfas.or.kr/?pCulture=en), and was a research intern at [Adobe Research](https://research.adobe.com).
