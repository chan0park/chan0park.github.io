I’m a PhD candidate advised by [Yulia Tsvetkov](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ytsvetko/) at [Language Technologies Institute](https://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu). I'm currently at [University of Washington](https://www.cs.washington.edu) as a visiting PhD student. My research interests are in the area of natural language processing and computational social science.

More specifically, I study the importance of sociocultural knowledge in the context of NLP (e.g., "how does language differ by a speaker's cultural and social background?") and how to make language technologies more socioculturally aware. Ultimately, my research aims to make NLP models more effective and fairer by being adopted by diverse populations and social groups. Additionally, I am interested in making the latest language technologies more accessible and practically applicable for other disciplines such as social science, politics, and communication studies.

<!-- My recent work includes projects related to sentiment and emotion analysis, hate speech detection, community-aware norm violation detection, social media analysis, and media bias analysis.  -->
<!-- Ultimately, I’d like to use NLP techniques to enable cross-cultural comparative research and to better identify and understand social problems. -->

I am currently a recipient of [KFAS Fellowship](https://eng.kfas.or.kr) and was a research intern at [Facebook AI](https://ai.facebook.com) and [Adobe Research](https://research.adobe.com). 
Before joining CMU, I received my bachelor's and master's degrees from [Yonsei University](https://www.yonsei.ac.kr/en_sc/), South Korea.
