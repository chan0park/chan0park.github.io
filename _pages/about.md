I’m a PhD candidate advised by [Yulia Tsvetkov](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ytsvetko/) at [Language Technologies Institute](https://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu). I'm currently at [University of Washington](https://www.cs.washington.edu) as a visiting PhD student. My research interests are in the area of natural language processing and computational social science.

My research specifically centers on the importance of sociocultural knowledge within the context of NLP, investigating the ways in which language use differs based on people's cultural and social background. I aim to enhance the sociocultural awareness of language technologies to improve their effectiveness, fairness, and adaptability to diverse populations. Additionally, I'm interested in making the latest language technologies more accessible and practical for other disciplines, such as social science, political science, and communication studies.

<!-- My recent work includes projects related to sentiment and emotion analysis, hate speech detection, community-aware norm violation detection, social media analysis, and media bias analysis.  -->
<!-- Ultimately, I’d like to use NLP techniques to enable cross-cultural comparative research and to better identify and understand social problems. -->

I am currently a recipient of [KFAS Fellowship](https://eng.kfas.or.kr) and was a research intern at [Facebook AI](https://ai.facebook.com) and [Adobe Research](https://research.adobe.com). 
Before joining CMU, I received my bachelor's and master's degrees from [Yonsei University](https://www.yonsei.ac.kr/en_sc/), South Korea.
