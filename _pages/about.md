I’m a third-year PhD student advised by [Yulia Tsvetkov](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ytsvetko/) at [Language Technologies Institute](https://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu). My research interests are in the area of natural language processing and artificial intelligence. 

More specifically, I’m interested in understanding people’s emotions and affects manifested in text and how they are different by language and culture. My recent work includes projects related to multilingual affect analysis, multilingual hate speech detection, and cross-lingual transfer. Ultimately, I’d like to use NLP techniques to enable cross-cultural comparative research and to better identify and understand social problems.

I am currently a recipient of [KFAS Fellowship](http://kfas.or.kr/?pCulture=en) and was a research intern at [Adobe Research](https://research.adobe.com). 
Before joining CMU, I received my bachelor's and master's degrees from [Yonsei University](https://www.yonsei.ac.kr/en_sc/), South Korea.
